For some reason the NUC did not have a static IP set.
To set the static IP of any ethernet interface use:

sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

edit the file so that it has this format:

auto lo eth0
iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet static
        address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 
        netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 
        gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 

exit then:

sudo reboot

If you are using an ethernet adpater, you have to temporarily set the IP.
To do that run:

Sudo ifconfig eth0 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 

Has to be done EVERY time the adapter is inserted.
